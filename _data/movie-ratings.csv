The Master,80,"2 powerhouse performances with some iconic scenes, but lack of narrative drive makes the film ultimately feel a little hollow."
The Post,70,Pretty mediocre on all accounts. Somewhat fails at the critical task of creating a high stakes atmosphere. Wasn't a fan of the focus on the newspaper company rather than the story being uncovered.
Mystic River,80,Solid film but questionable ending.
Lost in Translation,98,"A reflection on life, love and loneliness. A beautiful film that will make you contemplate the tenderness of human connection."
Panic Room,75,Simple script with some plot holes but first-rate directing makes the watch worthwhile.
The Invisible Guest,90,"Fantastic thriller with a deep, twisting plot."
First Reformed,70,A character study that is somewhat profound but slightly bland in its presentation. Raises some interesting questions but ultimately falls a little flat in the final act.
Memories of Murder,80,"Engaging murder mystery that gets more and more intense as it goes on, but suffers from quite a slow pace that makes it drag in places."
Blood Simple,60,Started strong but then the characters began doing inexplicable things and the pace slowed almost to a halt.
Joint Security Area,90,"A great whodunit style mystery film that poignantly explores the notion of friendship, whilst also providing an interesting geopolitical commentary."
Point Break,80,Fairly standard action film but the setting and vibe gives it an original  feel and some fantastic action sequences make it worth a watch.
A Beautiful Mind,85,Great movie on John Nash.
Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle,90,Top quality stoner comedy with great characters and plenty of laughs.
Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,80,"Great comedy, almost as good as the first one."
MacGruber,80,"Basically the US version of Johnny English, very cheesy but hilarious."
"Planes, Trains and Automobiles",80,Funny movie.
The LEGO Movie,75,Some funny moments and entertaining social satire.
Tenet,70,"Plot is very hard to follow and characters feel underdeveloped, but the originality and huge set pieces will make it worth a watch for some."
Lady Bird,0,
Everybody Wants Some!!,90,"Feels a bit off-beat at first, but ends up being very funny and enjoyable. It's in the style of a 'jock' movie but is not so much cheesy/trashy but actually quite grounded and real - the acting, characters and interactions are what really makes this film."
Irréversible,70,
In the Mood for Love,70,Good but a little too restrained for my liking. Not enough substance and character development to really pull me in.
The Revenant,80,"Epic journey that is beautifully shot, but lacks real character depth and gets a bit repetitive/starts to drag in places."
Honest Thief,65,A pretty average Liam Neeson action flick. Not bad but not his best.
Agent Cody Banks,60,The sequel was a childhood favourite but never saw the original until now. Not as good but still enjoyable.
A Rainy Day in New York,70,Poor at first but ends up being very charming.
Wonderwoman 1984,75,"Plot is weak at times and CGI looks somewhat unfinished, however the direction the movie takes is interesting and ends up being oddly wholesome. Also I thought Gal Gadot put in a great performance."
Vicky Christina Barcelona,80,"Definitely an alluring and thought provoking piece, but does feel a bit unstructured towards the end."
Whatever Works,75,"Funny movie, even if a bit hit and miss."
Midnight in Paris,70,"The Paris setting is captured beautifully, however I felt that there were more interesting themes that could have been explored, rather than focusing on the nostalgia aspect. Also wasn't a big fan of Owen Wilson for the lead role."
On the Rocks,60,"As expected from Sofia Coppola. Definitely has its moments, but ultimately did not manage to properly impact me."
To Rome with Love,70,"Very quirky film. Some of it works, some of it doesn’t. The parts that work are great."
Brothers by Blood,75,"Not much action, but the characters were compelling enough to carry the film. Also loved the gritty Philly setting."
Run. Hide. Fight.,70,Action flick on a touchy subject. Fairly generic but is well executed with solid pacing and a suspenseful atmosphere.
A Most Violent Year,80,"An all-round strong showing, that took quite a different angle to what I was expecting. Could be described as an atmospheric thriller meets character study, that manages to humanise the struggle between power and morality. I was particularly impressed by Oscar Isaac's performance and Bradford Young's cinematography."
Boiler Room,80,Enticing film offering an insight into the world of boiler room brokers.
Nobody,70,Basically John Wick but if he was a family man.
Without Remorse,60,"A weak and predictable script, but Michael B. Jordan and some good action scenes somewhat ease the pain."
Another Round,70,"Pacing suffers a bit in the first half, but overall a fun film with an interesting message."
Borat,90,Hilarious. They don't make em like this anymore.
Those Who Wish Me Dead,80,"A bit rough round the edges, but still a very solid movie that delivers a tense atmosphere and fast-paced action."
Wrath of Man,75,"Good action movie with some originality, although at times it comes through as convolution rather than interesting."
Rifkin's Festival,60,"The usual Woody Allen recipe, but a little weak and contrived, especially in the beginning."
The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard,60,
The Suicide Squad,80,"Very funny, heavy on the self satire, feels like what Guardians of the Galaxy did for Marvel, but more mature."
No Time To Die,75,
Free guy,70,
The Guilty,60,
Che: Part Two,70,
Midsommar,60,"Promising first half, but the plot starts to overeach and soon becomes  a bit nonsensical."
Cassandra's Dream,70,A poor script gets carried by quality acting and directing.
Children of Men,80,
Marriage Story,75,
Dune,90,"A masterful film on all accounts. The only criticism I would give is that it feels like we only scratch the surface in this first installment, and as such I don't feel entirely satisfied when the credits roll."
Polytechnique,80,Powerful film that makes for an intense viewing.
Halloween (1978),60,
Black Widow,60,
Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings,70,"Some good action scenes and definitely has its moments, but the narrative seems to change direction constantly and character motivations don't always make sense."
A Bittersweet Life,85,"Brutal and gripping thriller with a wistful depth and a stylish edge. Sometimes the characters feel a little inconsistent, but overall the execution is excellent."
American Beauty,85,
Jackie Brown,80,Classic early Tarantino. Great characters and dialogue but a bit lacking in structure and overarching narrative.
Before The Devil Knows You're Dead,80,Solid film with some fantastic acting. However there are some attempts to be stylistically edgy that don't quite hit the mark.
Last Night in Soho,75,"Stylistically excellent with quality directing, however the plot never feels like it is really going anywhere. The horror elements also feel a bit out of place."
The Last Duel,75,"Great set and costume design, fantastic action scenes, but the storytelling structure is slightly tiresome and characters feel a bit one-dimensional. Also a lot of the accents were awful."
State of Play,80,"Great thriller that finds its strength in a high quality, engaging script."
Boogie Nights,85,
Life Itself,80,"Takes a bit of time to find its rhythm, but eventually pulls you in and hits you right in the feels."
Blue Valentine,60,
Spider-Man: No Way Home,80,
West Side Story,70,"Looks pretty in terms of cinematography, set and costume design. Very high potential but I find musicals heavily detract from the viewer's immersion, so for me it's limited in that respect. Ansel Elgort gives a fairly wooden performance as usual, everyone else is fantastic. I do question the choice to not subtitle any of the Spanish - was fine for me but there was a lot of it, which may be infuriating for non speakers."
Matrix: Resurrections,40,"Weak story that is just a rehash of the first film, minimal character development, no emotional investment, and somehow feels like a budget film. Also so much fan service it's ridiculous."
The Night Before,80,Funny AND wholesome. Great xmas movie.
Don't Look Up,85,"Excellent film with a powerful message. However it is a bit heavy-handed in its style, especially when it gets bogged down in the (not so subtle) US politics social commentary. The pacing could also be tightened up."
Palm Springs,80,Fresh take on the time loop idea. Funny and quirky in the right ways.
Nightmare Alley,70,
The Green Knight,60,"Looks pretty and plays with some interesting camera work, but ultimately feels quite hollow and is painfully slow."
The Batman,70,"Loved the dark and gritty style of the film and the fantastic cinematography. However I didn't find the plot that engaging, the stakes never felt high and the storyline didn't seem to flow very well. Especially towards the end, when the riddler recruited some kind of extremist paramilitary group, this felt out of place and forced and tonally different from the rest of the film. Also Robert Pattinson looked a bit young and skinny to fit the Batman role, and his character felt a little too 'awkward emo kid'. Soundtrack was also a bit samey and repetitive. The riddler was a reasonably interesting character, but was a bit too absent in the film and his motivations were never totally clear. From the other characters, Falcone, Penguin and Catwoman were great but Gordon and Alfred felt rather one dimensional."
Forgetting Sarah Marshall,80,
The Hunt (2020),70,
Widows,60,
Licorice Pizza,50,
Ambulance,70,"Entertaining, although even more dizzying and disorientating than the usual MB film."
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,70,"A fun film at times, and I enjoyed the darker aspects, but it gets a bit silly towards the end and I couldn't take it seriously."
The Northman,80,"Excellent film with a unique style - brooding and brutal. The stylistic choices can be a bit too much at times and characters could have been fleshed out more, but overall this allegorical tale definitely hits the mark."
Top Gun : Maverick,85,
The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent,90,"Fantastic, unique and lively film that is full of energy. It's not afraid to take risks, managing to perfectly walk the line between self-satire and real creativity."
"Everything, Everywhere, All at Once",85,"Started out confusing and wacky not in a good way, but ended up being wacky and weird in the best way."
25th Hour,60,
Patriots Day,60,
The Worst Person in the World,70,
Gray Man,75,"Like Bourne meets Man on Fire but nowhere near as good. Pretty mediocre in all areas, although the main cast do bring a bit of charm to the roles."
Boiling Point,75,"High paced and intense, impressively shot in one take. But annoying that every character is a bit of an arsehole."
The Hand of God,70,"Has its moments, but overall didn't have the depth I was hoping for and fell a little flat."
Thor: Love and Thunder,60,Some good moments and laughs but pretty mediocre and self-contained. Also some poor CGI and awkward product placement.
Men,75,"Starts off suspenseful and and intriguing, and I enjoyed the extensive imagery and metaphors throughout, however the premise is stretched a bit too thin and ties up with a wtf ending."
Zack Snyder's Justice League,90,"Infinitely better than the initial release, every aspect of the movie is vastly improved and it feels like the deserving sequel to MoS and BvS. Very long but in this case it's for the better and very few scenes feel unecessary."
Inside Job,80,"Good exposition on the financial crisis, although a bit bland in its presentation."
Van Helsing,80,"CGI is a bit dated and can be bit cheesy at times, but it's sylistically fantastic and was a childhood favourite."
Bullet Train,90,"Original style, perfect pacing, great dialogue, quality action, genuinely funny, fully recommended."
Triple Frontier,80,
The Goldfinch,70,
Parallel Mothers,75,"Definitely an interesting tale, but it didn't seem to all tie together perfectly. All the ingredients were there but a lack of true depth remained."
2001: A Space Odyssey,70,"A slow and abstract film. I'm sure this was mind-blowing when it came out, but in the present day it feels rather aged and presents little that really stands out."
The Last Boy Scout,90,"Old school action film that has some real depth, lots of laughs and oozes with character. Highly entertaining from start to finish."
"Argentina, 1985",80,"Powerful and deep, lined with some funny moments."
The Good Boss,75,
Avatar 2,60,
Glass Onion,70,
The Banshees of Inisherin,80,"An original film, thought provoking and lonely, but also endearing in its own weird way."
The Menu,85,"A fantastically made film that is captivating and somewhat absurd, but the allegorical themes on artistic expression and obsession really hit the mark for me."
Emily the Criminal,75,"Engaging film, nothing outstanding but it's a bit different and holds your attention until the end."
Blood Diamond,85,
Nope,50,
Decision to Leave,80,"There are moments where Chan-wook's greatness shines through, but as an overall package it doesn't doesn't quite stand as an equal to his other greats. Still very much a good film, it is beautifully shot and crafts a fantastic noir atmosphere, but I was not completely sold on the depth of the central relationship and the pacing/editing was a bit offbeat."
Crank,80,"Silly, outrageous and over the top, but also action packed, hilarious and will get your adrenaline pumping."
Bones and All,65,"I found the central theme rather unsettling, the pacing a bit slow, and character development a bit shallow, but the well crafted atmosphere kept me somewhat invested at least."
Beverly Hills Cop,75,"Feels a bit dated, but otherwise a funny and entertaining cop movie."
Violent Cop,80,"Dark, raw and violent. A nihilistic film that is full of character, yet leaves you feeling empty."
Triangle of Sadness,75,"I didn't find this particularly thought provoking, although somehow it still felt interesting and kept me engaged. I couldn't really take the satire seriously and it tended to make me laugh rather than think. I don't know if that was the intention of the film, but for me it's greatest quality was certainly the comedy factor."
All Quiet on the Western Front,75,"Brings a fresh perspective on WWI and I commend the depiction of the harsh realities of trench warfare. However it is a bit predictable at times, somewhat drawn out, and I didn't connect with all the characters as much as I would have liked to."
Babylon,50,"Wacky and bloated, there are a lot of elements that just come across as convoluted and nonsensical. It does maintain some entertainment value, but overall feels way too indulgent."
Cartel Land,70,"Interesting, although a little lacking in structure and the Arizona based storyline felt out of place."
I Saw the Devil,75,"Visceral and unsettling, this film pulls you in with a powerful first act, however I found the storyline soon became a bit far fetched and contrived which took me out of it."
Official Competition,80,"Brilliantly executed satire that is both interesting and funny, sprinkled with just a hint of avant-garde abstraction to deliver a refreshingly lively piece."
The Insider,80,"Well directed, well shot and well acted with a sharp script. It had incredible potential, however even though I was engaged from start to finish, I felt the story didn't flow with a real energy until the final act."
Samsara,90,"I found this to be a completely engrossing experience, different to any other film I've seen. It's a meditative, reflective, and strangely cathartic piece. There are sections of the film where the narrative seeps through with a stronger focus, but I actually found the more abstract shots where I could just let my thoughts run free to be the most enjoyable."
Luther: The Fallen Sun,50,"Massively let down by some shoddy editing and an awful plot that's full of holes."
21 Grams,70,"A sobering tale that is certainly compelling to watch, but suffers from a confusing structure and ultimately leaves you unsure of the message to be gleaned."
Cocaine Bear,60,"Some funny moments and mildly entertaining, but not quite as outrageous as I was hoping."
Aftersun,85,"A precious film that manages to bring a moving and wistful magic to the screen through a symphony of simple, subtle moments."
Vortex,75,"Sad, bleak, depressing… this film is certainly powerful in what it sets out to achieve, doing so in a stylistically unique manner and with such authenticity that it feels almost too real at times."
12 Monkeys,70,"Engaging and original, but a bit too wacky in its style for my liking. Also quite hard to follow at times."
The Covenant,75,"Crams a lot into just 2 hours and some parts feel a bit disjointed, but overall a solid offering with strong lead performances."
12 Angry Men,90,"A film with a simple structure that nonetheless manages to be completely captivating."
Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,70,"Terrible start but soon finds its charm. Entertaining with a likeable set of characters."
The Bicycle Thieves,80,"Lots of charm to the film but it doesn't particularly bring a wow factor to a modern viewer."
The Chaser,65,"Interesting and different style to the usual, but did not achieve a particularly intense atmosphere or feel like high stakes for most of the film. A couple of very annoying plot devices too."
Captain Phillips,80,
A Separation,85,"An excellent Iranian drama piece that feels authentic and grounded."
Extraction 2,75,"2 hours of virtually non-stop action, most of which is high quality, with some creative camera work. However don't expect much of a gripping plotline."
13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,85,"Intense, high-paced, realistic action carries this film, which is also surprisingly well directed."
Bullitt,60,"Nothing particularly stood out except the car chase which was excellent."
John Wick: Chapter 4,50,"Didn't really follow the plot, but it seemed so nonsensical that I don't think it would've made any difference. This film is definitely carried by the non-stop action, which is very well choreographed but every bad guy's aim is worse than a stromtrooper which ruins the immersion and believability to a large extent. Keanu's acting is as wooden as a tree like usual."
Wild Tales,80,"A bit silly in places, but overall a highly entertaining set of stories, crafted with an underlying dark humour."
Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One,80,"Solid film with lots of outstanding action, an interesting plot and some fantastic scenes."
Thirteen Lives,70,"Interesting story but doesn't get properly going until the second half, complemented by a couple of awful British accents."
10 Things I Hate About You,80,
Rounders,85,"Good writing, good characters, a bit nostalgic, just all round an enjoyable film."
The Great Beauty,70,"Has its captivating moments that truly capture the beauty of life, but in between there is a lot of rather eccentric and slightly bizarre content that leaves it overall feeling a bit thin. The setting, cinematography and soundtrack also very much deserve a nod."
The Flash,60,"Had great potential in its concept and ambition, but the execution felt pretty scattered and all over the place."
Shoplifters,75,"A heartfelt film but its understated style left me feeling a bit underwhelmed."
Sonatine,70,
Oppenheimer,75,"A very well made film on an interesting topic, but at the end of the day its just a biopic with 3 hours of talking. It never feels truly intense and edge of your seat, which is what I've come to expect from Nolan."
La Haine,80,"A sharp script, realistic characters and well stylised production come together to highlight important themes that still remain relevant 30 years later."
Barbie,50,"Way too in your face with its message, there was no subtlety and parts of the film were basically just characters reading out a lecture. It was abstract in all the wrong ways, forcing quirkiness without adding any underlying intelligence or quality filmaking. The main redeeming factor is that there were quite a lot of funny moments (especially Ryan Gosling)."
Silenced,80,"Horrible but great."
Biutiful,85,"Heartfelt film that's full of soul and real, human characters. In particular, Bardem gives an incredible performance with layers and subtelty to his lead role."
Embrace of the Serpent,80,
Infernal Affairs,80,"Fantastic plot with enough depth and complexity to stay engaged throughout. The editing and cinematography is pretty slick on the whole but feels a bit cheesy in some moments."
X,50,"Interesting style, good cinematography, quite weird, very average."
Pearl,70,"Outstanding lead performance but everything else is pretty average."
5cm per second,50,"Turns out I don't really like anime."
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,90,"Excellent film on most accounts. It has a particularly unique and creative art style and manages to craft some real, deep relationship dynamics. The only real criticism is that some of the core plot elements, especially the villain, are a bit weak."
The Twilight Samurai,75,"Pensive and sentimental film that I quite enjoyed, but the plot wasn't as compelling as it could have been and some characters lacked proper development. Also the ending is annoying."
Kubo and the Two Strings,70,"A slow start and fairly weak ending lets down an otherwise pleasant and charming movie."
Violent Night,40,"Some entertaining violence but it's pretty silly and not that funny. The dad's acting is terrible."
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3,80,"One of the better of the recent Marvel films that actually has some real substance and soul."
Killers of the Flower Moon,80,"Very long but kept me engaged and interested nonetheless. Nothing mindblowing but just great filmmaking."
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,60,
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,75,
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,50,
Come and See,80,"Powerful film but lacked the finesse to achieve true greatness."
Cinema Paradiso,85,"Excellent film crafted with passion and love, but the ending in the theatrical cut is a bit jarring and left me unsatisfied. Will watch the Director's Cut at some point."
Ikiru,75,		
Mean Streets,75,"Very enjoyable even if it is a bit rough around the edges."
Wonka,60,"A bit weird but fairly enjoyable."
Missing,70,"Quite engaging with some smooth editing."
Grave of the Fireflies,80,"Powerful film that will pull at your heart strings, although the aged animation perhaps holds it back in places."
Lawrence of Arabia,90,"Beautiful cinematography, majestic score, brilliant pacing, engaging script, a masterful film on all fronts."
Miller's Crossing,75,"Strong script but lacks polish and a real wow factor."
Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan,60,"Fairly interesting but suffers pacing issues and a lack of real emotion investment."
Harakiri,85,"Dark but beautiful cinematography and sound capture this capitivating samurai tale."
Godzilla Minus One,70,"Weak first half but recovers and finishes strong."
Poor Things,90,"Absurd but brilliant, and totally hilarious."
Fallen Leaves,60,
Solaris,70,"Very interesting concept that wasn't realised to its full potential. Quite slow moving, it shows elements of brilliance without being thoroughly entertaining. Maybe too intelligent for its own good, it definitely requires a very thinking viewer."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer,60,"An interesting core plot idea that was mostly ruined by an absurd style of dialogue."
The Killer,70,
Escape from Kabul,80,"A lot more intense than I anticipated, a very interesting look at a bleak and fragile situation."
A Haunting in Venice,50,
Blue Beetle,50,
Eastern Promises,75,
Transcendence,60,
Requiem for a Dream,90,		
Dune: Part Two,90,
Perfect Blue,50,
The Fallout,65,"Kinda made me hate gen Z but also had its touching moments."
The Creator,75,"Beautiful cinematography, great soundtrack and thematically interesting, however the plot isn't particularly cohesive and the main actor gives a mediocre performance."
A Moment to Remember,70,"Mediocre for most of the film but the final act is incredibly powerful."
Rise of the Planet of the Apes,60,"Fairly entertaining but a bit silly at times."
Into the Wild,60,"Technically well made film but I felt the central character was misrepresented and his struggle overly romanticised, and the overall message was very questionable."
Civil War,60,"Some cool shots, stylistically quite unique, tackles some interesting themes and is unashamedly violent. However im not really sure what the point of the film was and it all felt a bit too abstract and weirdly specific without any explanation."
Mirror,60,"Triggered something viscerally and emotionally but I didn't really know what was happening in the film."
At Eternity's Gate,70,"Beautifully shot to look like a painting, excellently acted, but a bit too artsy fartsy and drawn out to be truly great."
Onibaba,60,"Some interesting allegorical themes but ultimately I don't think this aged very well."
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare,70,
The Lives of Others,85,	
Headhunters,75,
Hit Man,80,"Great plot and writing, good jokes, original and quirky in the right ways."
Death Proof,70,"A bit too over the top but still pretty entertaining. The overarching plot lingered in the background and it was mostly just girls chatting shit. Plenty of funny moments and insane sequences."
Blue Velvet,70,"Very strange watch but quite entertaining with good pacing. Frank is a great character."
The Butterfly Effect,85,"Do not watch the Director's Cut imo, the ending is ridiculous. Theatrical cut is way better. Very intriguing film, the plot does become quite far fetched towards the end of the film but overall it's a great watch and is quite moving."
The Masquerade,75,"Enjoyable and easy to watch, some poweful characters and all round pretty to look at."
Top Secret!,55,"Pretty stupid on the whole but had a decent number of funny moments."
The Celebration,80,"Quite chaotic with a variety of wacky characters, but was very engaging and a bit of a rollercoaster. Very much enjoyed, even if it was a lot darker than I was expecting..."
